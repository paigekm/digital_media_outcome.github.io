        <h2>Top tips from us</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>If you're staying at Brown Hut or Gouland Downs Hut - these huts don't have gas cooking facilities or lighting. You'll need to take: Portable stove and fuel, Candles</li>
    <li>You can't buy food on the track.

      Bring food that is lightweight, fast cooking and high in energy value. For example:<br>
      
      Breakfast: cereal/porridge/oats, firm bread, honeyor other spreads<br>
      Lunch: cracker biscuits, cheese, salami, jam/jelly, fruit<br>
      Dinner: instant soup, pasta or rice, dried vegetables or fruit, cheese or dehydrated (freeze-dried) meals.<br>
      You'll also need water, snacks, biscuits, muesli bars, tea or coffee, powdered fruit drinks and emergency food in case of any delays on the track.</li>
      <li>If you're camping: Bring a Tent, Sleeping mat, Portable stove and fuel</li>
